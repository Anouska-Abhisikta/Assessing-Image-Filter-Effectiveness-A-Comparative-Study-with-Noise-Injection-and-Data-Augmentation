# Assessing-Image-Filter-Effectiveness-A-Comparative-Study-with-Noise-Injection-and-Data-Augmentation
Research investigates the impact of data augmentation and noise injection on image filtering techniques for static image denoising and recognition tasks using the MNIST dataset, evaluating various filters and measuring performance with PSNR and NMSE.

## About the dataset
The MNIST Handwritten Digit Dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset in the field of machine learning and computer vision. It consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9), with 60,000 images used for training and 10,000 for testing. Each image is a 28x28 pixel square, making it a popular choice for tasks such as digit recognition and image classification.
